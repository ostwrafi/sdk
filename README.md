An SDK (Software Development Kit) in C++ is a collection of tools, libraries, documentation, and samples that help developers build software applications for a specific platform, framework, or API. SDKs provide pre-written code, compilers, debuggers, and other utilities to simplify development.

What’s Included in an SDK?
A C++ SDK typically contains:

Libraries – Precompiled code that provides functionalities for a particular service (e.g., graphics, networking, AI).
Header Files (.h) – Definitions of classes, functions, and macros needed for development.
Documentation – Guides, API references, and usage examples.
Sample Code – Example projects to demonstrate SDK usage.
Compiler & Debugger – Some SDKs include compilers (e.g., Microsoft Windows SDK with MSVC).
Build Tools – Scripts or makefiles to automate compilation and linking.
Examples of Popular C++ SDKs
Windows SDK – For developing Windows applications.
DirectX SDK – For game development and graphics programming.
OpenCV SDK – For computer vision and image processing.
Android NDK (Native Development Kit) – To develop Android apps in C++.
CUDA SDK – For GPU programming with NVIDIA GPUs.
Using an SDK helps developers avoid reinventing the wheel by providing ready-to-use tools and APIs for faster development.
